This is an example application of [rhizome][rhizome], a web server for  participative performances and installations. 

Basically, participants can use their mobile device to visit the rhizome page, and we use javascript to detect gyroscope data (modern browsers please!!), send OSC command to [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io) through [rhizome][rhizome], changing the audio and visuals.
